# The CD process can be very individual.
# The template has numerous parameters to configure the behavior separately for each environment.

#
# In the following example, each change is incorporated into the Int environment without any restrictions.

- stage: CD_int

# Subsequently, the CD_uat pipeline stage will be initiated. 
# It is dependent on the CD_int stage and must first be approved by selected users. 
# During PR creation, reviewers are assigned and the PR-Auto-complete function is deactivated.
